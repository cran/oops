# oops 0.2.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Removed dependency on `pryr` using C function from Dirk Eddelbuettel for printing environment addresses.
* Fixed vignette "Building an Artificial Neural Network with 'oops' Layers to Forecast Inflation" example at the end which used `&&` instead of `&`.
