Title: S3 Style Object Oriented Programming
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Christopher Mann <cmann3@unl.edu>
Maintainer: Christopher Mann <cmann3@unl.edu>
Description: Create simple, hassle-free classes with reference semantics
    similar to 'RefClass' or 'R6' but relying on S3 methods. "oops" class 
    instances tend to be lighter weight and faster to create. Creating a 
    class is as easy creating a list, while generating an instance is a 
    simple function call. Support for inheritance and fixed field classes.
